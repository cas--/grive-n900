You need the following libraries (I will add the arm .so files):

- json-c
- libcurl
- libstdc++
- libgcrypt
- Boost (Boost filesystem and program_option are required)

There are also some optional dependencies:
- CppUnit (for unit tests)
- libbfd (for backtrace)
- binutils (for libiberty, required for compilation in OpenSUSE & ubuntu)
